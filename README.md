# untitled-keyboard-project
Unnamed custom mechanical keyboard project. I might finish this one day. It'll probably be a split layout. But eh...

Project Roadmap:
- V.0: Simple layout prototype for minimal functionality and software testing (probably 40%-size amount of keys)
- V.1: Ergonomic form layout and bigger layout (60%+ or 40% with different layers)
- V.2+: Bluetooth support, different layouts, on board LED display, backlighting (stretch goal, I doubt I will get this far lol)
