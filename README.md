# untitled-keyboard-project
Unnamed custom mechanical keyboard project. I might finish this one day. It'll probably be a split layout. But eh...

Project Phases
- V.0: Square layout prototype for minimal functionality and software testing (probably 40%)
- V.1: Ergonomic form layout and bigger layout (60%+ or 40% with different layers)
- V.2 and onwards: Bluetooth support, different layouts, on board LED display, backlighting (stretch goal, I doubt I will get this far lol)
